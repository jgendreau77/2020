      <h1>2020</h1>
      <h2>The Pandemic</h2>
      <p>In a country FAR, FAR, AWAY; A virus surfaces and is on the move as it spreads from country to country. While back here in America we just chill, but little did we know that the virus is already here. Chaos, as people start to get sick and die.</p>
		  
	  <p>As we figure out what this virus is and what to do about it. Then we give it a name; Coronavirus and then people don't wanna drink Corona, lol. Then the virus is called Covid-19, a nickname! Interesting.</p>
      
      <p>The virus starts to spread through America like the plague, as a lockdown nears and millions run to get TOILET PAPER! WHAT? Shelves empty, stocks crash, businesses close, America put on hold.  </p>
